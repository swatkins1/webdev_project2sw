    <h1><strong>Which Arcane Council Members are not going to see season 2</strong></h1>
    <h2><em>Spoilers for Arcane the series</em></h2>

    <section>
      <h2>Mel Medarda</h2>
      <a id="mel" href="ArcaneDeadpool.html">

        I love this woman, however that rocket was coming towards her. Might have been the last thing she’ll ever see.
        I saw her mom in the trailer, and yet I did not see her. So I think her mom will step up and maybe follow Mel’s
        route of peace, or lash out in revenge for losing another child. Or maybe she’ll be gravely injured and put on
        the sidelines for most of season 2.

      <h2>Victor</h2>

      <p>
        Although not a part of the council, he was there when the final voting happened. He’s gonna live, however he may
        also be gravely injured as well. He’s got to get to that final in-game form one way or another.

      <h2>Jayce Talis</h2>

        <img src="images/rsz_1jayce.png" alt="Jayce">
      </a>
      <p>He’s going to live, I’m not going to fight for my reasoning as much though. I just know he is.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Bolbok</h2>
      <a id="bolbok" href="ArcaneDeadpool.html">

      <p>
        Going by one of his quotes, “The Arcane is the curse of our world. My race was nearly destroyed by it,” I think
        he’s screwed for sure. The rocket uses arcane, otherwise known as magic. His kind may be wiped out with the
        rocket, sadly.

      <h2>Hoskel</h2>

      <p>
        He can’t even solve a puzzle made for kids. He has no purpose to the story besides comic relief or being someone
        to hate. He might live.

      <h2>Salo</h2>
      <a id="salo" href="ArcaneDeadpool.html">
        <img src="images/rsz_1salo.png" alt="Salo">
      </a>
      <p>I feel like Salo is even less memorable; I think he won’t make it.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Shoola</h2>
      <a id="shoola" href="ArcaneDeadpool.html">
        <img src="images/rsz_1shoola.png" alt="Shoola">
      </a>
      <p>Her design is really cool. She’s tied with Bolbok. If Bolbok is offed, Shoola better live.</p>

      <h2>Cassandra Kiramman</h2>
      <a id="cassandra" href="ArcaneDeadpool.html">

      </a>
      <p>
        This is the only one with major spoilers because it’s quite literally revealed in one of the trailers. One of
        the enforcers says, "We will avenge your mother," to who I assume would be Caitlyn. She’s definitely not going
        to see season 2.

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        In conclusion, I will avoid any spoilers or trailers for season 2. I want to go in completely blind on November
        23rd and watch the whole season in one go. Enjoy the intro for the show!
